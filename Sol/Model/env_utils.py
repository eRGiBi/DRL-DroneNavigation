    Generic cmd to pwm function.

    For 1D, thrust is the total of all 4 motors;
    for 2D, 1st thrust is total of motor 1 & 4, 2nd thrust is total of motor 2 & 3;
    for 4D, thrust is thrust of each motor.

        pwm2rpm_const (float): constant factor between PWM and RPMs.
        ct (float): torque coefficient.
        pwm_min (float): pwm lower bound.
